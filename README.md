# Limits of Learning Motion from Neural Nets

Searching the limits of how much Neural Networks can extract motion information given optical flow or sequence images

# Random Scene DepthMap Generator

## Overview
Generates random scenes of cubes on the and generates label maps and depth maps. 

## TODO
* Do better distribution on camera angles (conditional distribution)
* Generate random flying objects
* Generate flow
* Choose better focal length?
